Degrees = (Radians/PI)*180
Degrees = arcsin(x/y)

1. The lecture mentioned that one radian is approximately 57 degrees. What is it exactly (or to
at least three decimal places)? 
57.2958

2.A typical field of view used in 3D games is sixty degrees. What is this in radians?
radian = 57.2958
60/57.2958 = 1.0472
1.0472 radians

5.Again consider the three stakes laid out by the Egyptians to form a right-angled triangle.
Given that one of the angles is a right angle, what are the other two angles?
Hint: Use sine and cosine. 
180-90= 90, 90/2 = 45
the other two angles would both be 45 degrees.

6.For the next two exercises, you’ll need a calculator equipped with trig functions.
Alternatively, you can use the calculator built in to Windows, but you’ll need to set it up for
‘Scientific’ operations (one of the options on the View menu).
Given the following triangle:

find the length of ‘x’.
Hint: Use the Sine Rule. Re-arrange the terms so that one of the lengths is on the left-hand
side of the equation
180-79-37 = 64
3rd angle =64

sin 37 = sin 79
13  =   x

0.602 = 0.982
13  =   x

13  =   x
0.602 = 0.982

13  =   21.206
0.602 = 0.982

7.Given the following triangle:
Find the size of the specified angle.

a = 8, b = 6, c =9

Sin A = ?

Sin A = 8/9 a/c

0.01551341547

Degree A = (sin(8/9)
           (   PI  )  * 180  

.8888532322

angle x = .889

9^2 = 8^2 + 6^2 -2ab cos(C)

cos A = 6^2 +9^2 - 8^2
