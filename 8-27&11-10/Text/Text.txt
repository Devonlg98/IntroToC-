1.
A variable is a container that stores code either letters or numbers

2.
int is a number variable that can't be displayed with decimals, it's a whole number

3.
float is a number variable that can be displayed with decimals

4.
boolean is a variable that can only be true or false

5.
string is a variable that stores text

6.
Declaring a variable is done by defining which type of variable it is and then naming it.

7.
An example of declaring a variable would be: int gameScore;

8.
initialising a variable is when you give a variable a value

9.
An example of initialising a variable is int gameScore = 0;

10.
No ints can't have decimals

11.
Yes, floats can have decimals

12.
A good variable for an enemies health would be int, because it would lose health
in chunks instead of it having a sliver of health.

13.
a good variable for a type of players speed is float, because it would allow for more
smooth speed transitions that int wouldn't allow.

14.
a good variable for storing dialogue would be string, because it allows you to store text.

15.
a good variable for tracking if a player is alive is a boolean, because it's made for
true or false statements, if the player's health fell to zero, you could then set
the boolean for the player being alive to false.

16.
camelCase is when you begin variables with lower case letters and every word after starts
with a capital letter. For example gameScore playerWasDefeatedScreen.

17.
I would name a variable in code called "player power up" like this:
bool playerPowerUp;
